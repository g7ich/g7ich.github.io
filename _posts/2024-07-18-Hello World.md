**Hello Reader**,

I'm Kamil, and I want to learn new stuff, share my knowledge with others, and have fun with blogging. I've created this page to help myself stay motivated and document my journey in some form. I hope my next post will be more technical, but for now, let's get started with this quick introduction.

## What will be there?

As a practitioner in the field of cybersecurity, I'll try to post cybersecurity content, but I'd describe myself more as a technology enthusiast. So, it won't be just write-ups or secure configuration guidelines. From time to time, you'll probably see IoT-related content, and occasionally, some Home Lab experiments.

### Cybersecurity Corner

In the cybersecurity department, you can expect to find tutorials and guides suitable for beginners, as well as more advanced topics for those looking to dive deeper. I'll try to cover a wide range of subjects, including security best practices, threat analysis, and penetration testing. My goal is to make security accessible to everyone, so don't be afraid to ask questions or request specific topics.

### Smart Home and IoT Security

As someone interested in smart home automation and IoT security, I'll be exploring the latest trends and technologies in this space. You can expect to find posts on how to secure your smart home devices, maybe some DIY projects to help you automate your home while keeping it safe from prying eyes.

### Home Lab Adventures

In my Home Lab, I'll be experimenting with new technologies, setting up test environments, and pushing the limits of what's possible. I'll share my experiences, successes, and failures with you, so you can learn from my mistakes and maybe even get inspired to build your own Home Lab.

## What to Expect

Throughout this blog, as It's blog documenting mainly my learning journey please do not take content written here as technical advice unless I say so. I want you to feel like you're sitting down with a friend, discussing the latest tech trends and learning from each other. I'll do my best to keep my posts engaging, informative, and easy to follow, even for those who are new to the world of tech.

**I'm lucky enough to have you reading this, and I hope you'll stick around for the ride. Thank you, and let's get started!**
